# Project Title: Driver-Pedestrian Interaction Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the interactions between drivers and pedestrians using various data sources and visualization techniques. The data includes body joint positions and specific pedestrian scenarios, which are visualized through Jupyter notebooks and generated videos.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of the project is as follows:

```
Driver-Ped/

├── GeneratedVideos/
│
├── RawData/
│   ├── maps/
│   │   ├── Ped-104.jpeg
│   │   ├── Ped-105.jpeg
│   │   └── scene.jpeg
│   └── Pilot2/

└── ReadME.md
```

## File Descriptions

- **GeneratedVideos/**: This directory contains the HTMLs generated from the movement visualization notebooks.
- **RawData/**: This directory contains raw data files used in the analysis.
- **body joints list.xlsx**: This Excel file contains the list of body joints used for analyzing pedestrian movements.
- **Movement_Visualization_David.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for visualizing pedestrian movement data, developed by David.
- **Movement_Visualization_KK.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for visualizing pedestrian movement data, developed by KK.
- **ReadME.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and the directory structure.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Driver-Ped
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the raw data is placed in the `RawData/` directory.
2. **Running Notebooks**: Open the Jupyter notebooks (`Movement_Visualization_David.ipynb` and `Movement_Visualization_KK.ipynb`) in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. **Visualization**: Execute the cells in the notebooks to generate visualizations of the pedestrian movement data.

## Results

The results of the analysis are visualized in the form of plots and videos. These visualizations can be found in the `GeneratedVideos/` directory.

## Contributions

- **David**: Developed the `Movement_Visualization_David.ipynb` notebook.
- **KK**: Developed the `Movement_Visualization_KK.ipynb` notebook.
